# Profitability Prediction
<!-- Description -->

This model aims to predict the likelihood of stroke based on several features, including heart problems, age, gender, occupation, smoking habits, and other relevant health issues. By analyzing a dataset with these parameters, the model employs machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and correlations that contribute to the prediction of stroke risk. The predictive nature of the model is valuable for early detection and prevention, enabling healthcare professionals to take proactive measures for individuals at higher risk of stroke. It provides a tool for personalized health assessments and interventions, emphasizing the importance of targeted preventive measures in mitigating stroke risks
